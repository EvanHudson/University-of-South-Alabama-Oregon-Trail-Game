This project is a text-based roleplay game set in the style of the classic "Oregon Trail" game. The game takes place at the University of South Alabama, where you, the player, will navigate campus locations, interact with characters, and manage various aspects of your student life, including health, grades, and finances.

The game is powered by an AI assistant that responds to your choices and drives the story forward. The experience is enhanced with background music and animations.

    AI Integration: Uses the ollama AI model to generate narrative responses.
    Animation: Background animation is displayed while the game is running, enhancing the immersion.
    Music: Background music plays during the game to set the tone, featuring "Spaghetti Western Showdown."
    Multiple Locations: Explore different buildings and locations around the University of South Alabama campus.
    Character Stats: Manage stats such as health, GPA, and sleep deprivation, which affect the story progression.
